About     
  
Sanem Bulut's engagement with the art world began with an early, formative passion for creative expression. This intuitive connection was later solidified by a rigorous academic foundation at Hacettepe University’s Department of Philosophy, where she cultivated a multidisciplinary perspective by exploring the intersections of language, art, psychology, and sociology.

Her undergraduate studies became a critical turning point. It was here that a deep fascination with philosophy of art courses and critical theories of the 'culture industry' guided her first deliberate steps into contemporary art practice. Alongside these academic pursuits, she actively immersed herself in the professional art world, contributing to a diverse range of exhibitions, cultural events, and festivals. The extensive readings on 'consumption' she undertook during this period would later form the conceptual foundation for her first exhibition. This journey led her to the contemporary art and curatorship program by Akbank Sanat and Open Dialogue Istanbul, from which she graduated in 2025. She completed the program by curating her debut exhibition, "Sold Out," which presented a dynamic selection of works from both professional and emerging artists.

Today, her curatorial practice is driven by broader questions concerning the modern world. She is deeply invested in exploring the role of art within public spaces and seeks to answer how multiple disciplines can be brought into a cohesive dialogue. At the core of her work is the belief that the curator acts as a crucial unifier, weaving together diverse practices and perspectives to create new, shared meanings.
